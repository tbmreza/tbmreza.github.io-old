{"title":"Offend by Helping","slug":"2020-08-18-offend-by-helping","html":"\n<style>\n  h3 { margin-top: 2em; };\n  </style>\n\n<p>\n    Human state of mind is complex, and, by the reason of that, our interactions are as complex as\n    our minds. One of the proofs is when we offer to help someone. Helping is universally accepted\n    as a nice gesture, however, when we genuinely want to help, one can think that we are probably\n    up to something—there’s a hidden intention, or other whole lot of possibilities by connecting our\n    kind gesture to other possibilities.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This actually doesn&#39;t have a context as concrete as a recent incident that I saw or experience.\n    However, there will be the time when it&#39;s possibly happened, and maybe someday I will need to\n    soothe myself from feeling useless when my effort isn&#39;t appreciated, or I probably will be the one\n    who is taking offense. I hope having this thought in written form priorly will ease my brain when\n    that time eventually comes. It can happen anywhere from open source to office environment,\n    household to local community.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Why some people take offense in everything</h3>\n<p>\n    People tend to connect dots; when something happen, we connect it with thousands of other\n    possibilities. We connect those dots not because it&#39;s logical to do so, but it’s because our minds\n    are used to wander that way. It’s in our nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Human interaction is complex; it consists with many dots that we can connect. Other than that,\n    messages that are relevant to parties involved may not always be spontaneous or unintended.\n    Some are deliberate, some just cloud in the sky that looks like a rabbit, faces in object. These\n    unlock many other dots that one can possibly connect. Nevertheless, observing too deep into\n    things and connecting those dots causes things might look or even get bigger than it was.\n</p>\n<p>\n    From their point of view, when we offer our help, connecting the dots may come in thinking that\n    we are insincere in helping them—like we have hidden intention other than genuinely wants to\n    offer a helping hand. To begin with, here are some hypothetical dots:\n\n    <ul>\n        <li>Your teammate has something that will benefit the team.</li>\n        <li>You have an idea to improve that thing. As a decent teammate, you ask for their permission to realize your idea.</li>\n        <li>You have been in the company for 4 years.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    Those hypothetical dots might lead to another conclusion to be drawn to:\n    <ul>\n        <li>You are only doing this because you want to get a promotion.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    From the conclusion above, despite your genuine intention to improve the team, they think you\n    offer to realize your idea just for the sake of a promotion. Here are more dots:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Your teammate agrees to listen to your idea, then you explain how doing X will improve things</li>\n        <li>Your teammate sees some flaws in the details and asks you about it</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    From your point of view, when your teammate questions your idea, you may assume that they\n    are dishonest. You try to elaborate your idea, but are not even really convinced because after all,\n    it’s just an idea. You conclude that they only question about your idea just in spite of seeing you fail.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Why refrain from helping</h3>\n<p>\n    Legacy is something that is handed down by someone. The thing isn&#39;t necessarily ground-\n    breaking or hard to make, it&#39;s just associated with a person. Not everyone leaves legacy too,\n    which kind of makes it quite an achievement to leave a legacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When we offer to help someone, we also give away such thing as our ideas. If we decide to\n    release that idea only for ourselves, the credit goes a hundred percent to us—we are the one that\n    leaves legacy. On the other hand, when we offer to help, we share a credit or even there might be\n    the case where we don’t get credit at all for something that initially come from us. Credit sharing\n    devalues our legacy.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Offer, but don&#39;t be disappointed</h3>\n<p>\n    There might be the time when we can’t resist to offer our help. Or maybe, some of us is simply\n    that kind of people who don’t have the heart to see someone is struggling. At this point, we can’t\n    help but to offer help.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When we find ourselves caught up in that moment—when we can’t resist to offer help, we\n    should be ready for the possible outcome—that maybe the one who we offered to help connect\n    the dots and draw their own assumption regarding our supposedly kind gesture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although we have pure, genuine intention to help, there’s not a thing can stop that kind of\n    assumption thrown at us—it’s inevitable. When this happen, we need to soothe ourselves that it’s\n    okay if people who doesn’t know any better throw their own judgement on us, we just need to\n    work our way through the uneasy feeling that it cost us. Don’t let them ruin our good intention.\n    And it’s even better if we can seek middle ground when possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    &quot;Why?&quot; you ask. The person proceeds to explain his reasoning. It&#39;s correct, but for some reason\n    you can tell it&#39;s the real reason. You refute the point they were trying to make. At this point, you\n    know a ramble will come next. You decide to just nod and step away. This debate is not worth it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At the end of the day, you are still giving value. It&#39;s just a thank-you that you are missing.\n</p>\n"}
