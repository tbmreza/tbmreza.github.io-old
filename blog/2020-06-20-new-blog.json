I hope that I impressed you with the feels of my personal website. \n  I didn't modify much the Sapper template I scaffolded this website from, yes.\n  But the font, color combination... You've never seen anything like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On serious note, I'm really happy with my new blog. I will fill up this space with elaboration\n  of my thought on issues, my projects, and maybe explanation of concepts. \n  That sounds ambitious, but it is what I am aiming for.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The fact that this blog lacks comment section doesn't mean I am not open to interactions.\n  I appreciate your time visiting my blog and welcome any kind of feedback.
