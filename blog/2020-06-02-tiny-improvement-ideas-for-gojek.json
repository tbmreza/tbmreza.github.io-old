The initial idea was to replicate the original by assembling image and font file assets. I wanted to exercise layouting without designing first. It has added hours of HTML/CSS/JS work to me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Without necessarily saying that the original is bad, I found myself coming up with better ideas on some details. I am writing this blog to share some of them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    So hear me out, my tiny visual modification that I think will improve gojek.com:\n  </p>\n  <h3>Horizontal Scroll: Mobile experience has spoiled us</h3>\n  <p>\n    Points:\n    <ul>\n      <li>We swipe in mobile to interact with components like this. Naturally, I also tried to scroll in desktop. I wasn't surprised, but still disappointed.</li>\n      <li>CSS provides convenient property overflow-x: scroll. It's free.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </p>\n  <h3>Underline Animation: Simpler implementation</h3>\n  <p>\n    Points:\n    <ul>\n      <li>\"Underline ends where link text ends\" is easy to code. </li>\n      <li>\"Using :after pseudo-class, insert underline as content\", not so easy.</li>\n      <li>Ending at tip of arrow is easier to reason than at somewhere between text and arrow.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A few notes in defense of original website. Software development takes up whatever time you give them, there is always something to improve! Gojek design is a very good standard by all means, which is why improving their website is worth attempting at all. Also, I haven't considered browsers other than my phone/laptop's, which means the properties (overflow-x, etc) may not behave, look, or perform as expected. Basically I have skipped testing, the most important requirement of shipping software.\n  </p>\n  "}
