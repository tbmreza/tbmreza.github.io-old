  Welcome to my blog! I hope that I impressed you with the feels of my personal website. 
  I didn't modify much the Sapper template I scaffolded this website from, yes.
  But the font, color combination... You've never seen anything like this.
</p>
<p>
  On serious note, I'm really happy with my new blog. I will fill up this space with elaboration
  of my thought on issues, my projects, and maybe explanation of concepts. 
  That sounds ambitious, but it is what I am aiming for.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that this blog lacks comment section doesn't mean I am not open to interactions.
  I appreciate your time visiting my blog and welcome any kind of feedback. DM me on twitter
  where I am <a href="https://twitter.com/rezahandzalah">@rezahandzalah</a>.
